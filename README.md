Hâ‚ƒ - Hyperactive Hexagonal Havoc!
=======================

Realtime Multiplayer HTML5 game. Trace through sets of matching hexagons with your finger or your mouse cursor to score. If another players set overlaps yours and they claim it first, they steal your set!

Installing the local server
---------------------------
You'll need Node.js, which is easy to install with the download at [NodeJS.org](http://nodejs.org/).

Once you've cloned the git repo, navigate to it on the command line and run 

`npm install`

Which should install all of the server dependencies. At that point you should be able to start the local server by running 

`node server`

in the same directory. Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser and see the game in action! Give your IP to friends to play multiplayer matches!

Public Server
-------------
I'm trying to keep [http://h3.jit.su](http://h3.jit.su) up, but as a work-in progress the server may be prone to fits of outages.
